# AeonG
## Description
AeonG is a temporal graph database that efficiently supports
temporal features based on [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com). We provide a formally defined temporal property graph model,
based on which we fundamentally design AeonG with a temporal-enhanced storage engine and query
engine. AeonG utilizes a hybrid storage engine, in which we introduce a current store for maintaining
current graphs and a historical store for storing historical graphs migrated from the current storage under
MVCC management. Furthermore, AeonG equips a native temporal query engine to efficiently process temporal
queries with data consistency guarantees.

## Contributions

- Fast querying capabilities over subgraphs at a past time point or range
- Small storage overhead of historical data
- Native support of transaction time
- ACID compliance


## Getting Started

### Build System Dependencies
You can refer to the comprehensive documentation provided by [Memgraph](https://memgraph.notion.site/Quick-Start-82a99a85e62a4e3d89f6a9fb6d35626d) for building system dependencies. Additionally, we offer a Docker image to streamline this process. We highly recommend utilizing Docker for building AeonG.

    docker pull hououou/aeong:v1

    docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --mount type=bind source=$pwd,target=/home/ --entrypoint bash aeong

### Install libraries
Before compiling AeonG, you should activate the toolchain, which utilizes our own custom toolchain.

    source /opt/toolchain-vXYZ/activate

Apart from the system-wide installed dependencies, AeonG needs some libraries to be built locally. The proper setup of these libraries should be checked by running the init script.

    cd aeong
     ./init

### Compile
With all of the dependencies installed and the build environment set up, you need to configure the build system. To do that, execute the following:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..

If everything went OK, you can now, finally, run build AeonG binary and client binary.

    make -j$(nproc) memgraph
    cd tests/mgbench
    make 

### Run

After the compilation, you can run AeonG as follows:

    ./memgraph


## Benchmarks
We provide support for three temporal benchmarks to evaluate temporal performance. Additional details can be found in  [tests/benchmarks/README.md](/tests/benchmarks/README.md)

* We can automatically generate graph operation query statements for generating temporal data. To do that, execute the following:

        cd tests/benchmarks/$workloadname
        python create_graph_op_quries.py --arg $arg_value

* We can generate temporal query statements for evaluating temporal performance. To do that, execute the following:

        cd tests/benchmarks/$workloadname
        python create_temporal_query.py --arg $arg_value

## Tools
We provide tools for creating temporal databases and evaluating temporal database performance. These tools can be found in the [script directory](/tests/scripts/).

### Create temporal database
We provide a tool that can report the average graph operation query latency and the storage consumption of the generated temporal database. To use it, execute the following:

    cd tests/scripts/
    python3 create_temporal_database.py

You can specify optional arguments to generate the desired temporal database. Check specific arguments for each workload by executing:

    python create_temporal_database.py --help

|`--original-dataset-cypher-path`| Directory path indicating the original dataset cypher query statements           |
|`--index-cypher-path`| Index query path                                                           |

### Evaluate temporal query performance
We provide a tool that can report the average temporal query latency.

    cd tests/scripts/
    python3 evaluate_temporal_q.py

The arguments are almost the same as for `create_temporal_database.py`, except for `--temporal-query-cypher-path`, which indicates the temporal query path. You can specify optional arguments to generate the desired temporal database. Check the specific arguments for each workload by executing:

    python evaluate_temporal_q.py --help


### Run AeonG manually
You can also test AeonG performance according to your needs. We guide you with following steps:

* Download dataset
* Generate graph operation query statements. You can use generation tools in our benchmarks directory (`/benchmarks/$workload_name/create_graph_op_queries.py`).
* Create temporal database. You can use the tool in our script directory (`/tests/scripts/create_temporal_database.py`). It will report the graph operation query latency and storage consumption.
* Generate temporal query statements.  You can use generation tools in our benchmarks directory (`/benchmarks/$workload_name/create_temporal_query.py`).
* Evaluate temporal performance. You can use the tool in our script directory (`/tests/scripts/evaluate_temporal_q.py`). It will report the temporal query latency.


## AeonG Implementation
AeonG is an extension of Memgraph. Details of our concept can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12212v2/). You can also refer to Memgraph's [internal documentation](https://memgraph.notion.site/Memgraph-Internals-12b69132d67a417898972927d6870bd2) to better understand our code. We made the following major changes to support temporal features.

* Storage Engine:
  * Timestamps: Import timestamps into [Vertex](/src/storage/v2/vertex.hpp), [Edge](/src/storage/v2/edge.hpp), and [Delta](/src/storage/v2/delta.hpp) structures.
  * Data Migration: Add data migration in the [Storage::CollectGarbage()](/src/storage/v2/storage.cpp) function to migrate unreclaimed data to RocksDB.
  * Retain Historical Data in RocksDB: Utilize [historical_delta.cpp](/src/storage/v2/history_delta.cpp) to transfer deltas to key-value formats and store them to RocksDB.
* Query Engine:
  * Add Temporal Syntax in [Cypher.g4](/src/query/frontend/opencypher/grammar/Cypher.g4).
  * Extend Scan Operator: In the
    [ScanAllCursor.Pull()](/src/query/plan/operator.cpp) function, we introduce a function AddHistoricalVertices() to capture both unreclaimed and reclaimed historical versions.
  * Extend scan operator:   In the
    [ ExpandCursor.Pull()](/src/query/plan/operator.cpp) function, we introduce a function AddHistoricalEdges() to capture both unreclaimed and reclaimed historical versions.


## Configuration settings
We inherit the configuration settings from Memgraph, thus supporting all configurations described in Memgraph. For detailed information, please refer to this [link](https://memgraph.com/docs/configuration/configuration-settings). Additionally, AeonG supports three more configurations to provide temporal features.
